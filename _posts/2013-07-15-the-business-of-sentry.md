Two weeks ago I attended [EuroPython](http://europython.eu). It's one of my favorite
events of the year (likely because of the amazing venue it's been at for the last three
of those). This year I gave a talk on how we operate [Sentry](https://www.getsentry.com),
titled "Open Source as a Business". It goes into details on how we operate Sentry
(from the business perspective) and some of the challenges (as well as lessons) we've faced with it.

I'd love to hear from more people who are trying to turn side projects into actual
businesses. I'm sure there are many that are doing well besides Sentry, but it'd be
interesting to hear other stories, and to see if we all ended up with the same conclusions.

If you weren't at EuroPython, you can view the [slides on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/zeeg/open-source-as-a-business-europython-2013) as well as the [full recording on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVRVKYus7tI).
