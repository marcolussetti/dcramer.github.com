title: Mac OS X Security Update 2009-01 Fix for Perl and Fink

<p>As many users like myself probably have noticed, Apple seriously fucked us with their latest security release. From what I've read, they reverted Perl to an older version which doesn't support some common features.</p>

<p>I began receiving errors such as the following with fink and other applications:</p>

<ul><li><strong>IO object version 1.22 does not match bootstrap parameter 1.23</strong></li><li>Storable object version 2.15 does not match $Storable::VERSION 2.18</li><li>DB_File object version 1.814 does not match bootstrap parameter 1.817</li></ul>

<p>After a bit of searching, and trying some various things, I've come up with the following solution (which may be specific to my problems):</p>

<pre><br>mkdir -p /fixforperl<br>cd !$<br>curl -O http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/G/GB/GBARR/IO-1.2301.tar.gz<br>curl -O http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/P/PM/PMQS/DB_File-1.819.tar.gz<br>curl -O http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/A/AM/AMS/Storable-2.18.tar.gz<br>tar xzf IO-1.2301.tar.gz<br>tar xzf DB_File-1.819.tar.gz<br>tar xzf Storable-2.18.tar.gz<br>cd IO-1.2301 && perl Makefile.PL && make && sudo make install && cd ..<br>cd DB_File-1.819 && perl Makefile.PL && make && sudo make install && cd ..<br>cd Storable-2.18 && perl Makefile.PL && make && sudo make install && cd ..<br></pre>

<p>There may be other libraries which you need to update as well. These are just the ones I've encountered so far. The process is the same for each library. Simply grab the package off of CPAN, run the Makefile.PL, and make install.</p>
