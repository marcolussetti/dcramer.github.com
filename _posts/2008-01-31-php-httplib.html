<p>We've been working on our central authentication service at Curse lately, so we just began porting it's libraries to PHP. We plan to deploy it across all sites (specifically the vBulletin forum sites) very soon.</p>

<p>In order to achieve a working library in PHP, we needed some HTTP utilities. We didn't want to create dependencies with cURL, so I wrote a lightweight replica of the Python httplib (currently with no SSL).</p>

<p>For the curious, you can grab the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-httplib/">source at Google code</a>.</p>

<p>Also it seems recently they updated the source browser for Google code, check that out while you're there :)</p>
