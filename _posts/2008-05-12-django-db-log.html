<p>The question came up today, if there was a database logging solution available for Django. It turned out (to my knowledge) there wasn't. So I quickly came up with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-db-log">django-db-log</a>. It's a simply middleware which will catch exceptions in Django, and log them to the database, allowing you to easily view them via the admin or your own custom application.</p>
