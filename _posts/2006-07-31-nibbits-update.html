<p>I took some time Sunday to go over Nibbits and add the flexibility it's been needing. In doing this I added two new sections. One for <a href="http://abandonware.nibbits.com/">Abandonware Games</a>, and another for <a href="http://roms.nibbits.com/">Roms and Emulators</a>.</p>

<p>I think I'm finally closing in on a pretty solid framework for the CMS and will soon be accepting a couple sites to test run the software. The current TODO list includes:<br><ul><br><li>Internationalization</li><br><li>Templates</li><br><li>Advanced search functions</li><br><li>Caching</li><br><li>Reimplementing tag views</li><br></ul><br>For those interested, the latest changes were focused on SE flexibility for page names, such as "World of Warcraft Files" differing from "Roms and Emulators" as it has no section name appended to it. This fix was made by adding a field to both the site and the section, which lets you either use a sprintf formatted string, or simply overwrite it with a title.</p>

<p>The second major change was removing the globalization on sections. The way it's setup now is sections are generalized, but you set which sites hold which sections, and it also tracks when they were added. Two options were added to the configuration for adjusting how long to expire "new" items. One for sections, and one for site.</p>

<p>If you're interested in the Nibbits framework, please let me know dcramer@gmail.com and I will give you more information. I will be doing limited testing with it on external sites and will then begin licensing the software.</p>
