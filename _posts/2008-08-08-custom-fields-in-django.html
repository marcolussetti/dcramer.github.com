title: Custom Fields in Django

<p>I was helping someone today in the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/django">Django IRC channel</a> and the question came across about storing a denormalized data set in a single field. Typically I do such things by either serializing the data, or by separating the values with a token (comma for example).</p>

<p>Django has a built-in field type for <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/model-api/#commaseparatedintegerfield">CommaSeparatedIntegerField</a>, but most of the time I'm storing strings, as I already have the integers available elsewhere. As I began to answer the person's question by giving him an example of usage of serialization + custom properties, until I realized that it would be much easier to just write this as a Field subclass.</p>

<p>So I quickly did, and replaced a few lines of repetitive code with two new field classes in our source:</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> There were some issues with my understanding of how the metaclass was working. I've corrected the code and it should function properly now.</p>

<p><h3>SerializedDataField</h3></p>

<p>This field is typically used to store raw data, such as a dictionary, or a list of items, or could even be used for more complex objects.</p>

{% highlight python %}
from django.db import models
try:
    import cPickle as pickle
except:
    import pickle
import base64

class SerializedDataField(models.TextField):
    """Because Django for some reason feels its needed to repeatedly call
    to_python even after it's been converted this does not support strings."""
    __metaclass__ = models.SubfieldBase

    def to_python(self, value):
        if value is None: return
        if not isinstance(value, basestring): return value
        value = pickle.loads(base64.b64decode(value))
        return value

    def get_db_prep_save(self, value):
        if value is None: return
        return base64.b64encode(pickle.dumps(value))
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>SeparatedValuesField</h3>

An alternative to the CommaSeparatedIntegerField, it allows you to store any separated values. You can also optionally specify a <code>token</code> parameter.

{% highlight python %}
from django.db import models

class SeparatedValuesField(models.TextField):
    __metaclass__ = models.SubfieldBase

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.token = kwargs.pop('token', ',')
        super(SeparatedValuesField, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def to_python(self, value):
        if not value: return
        if isinstance(value, list):
            return value
        return value.split(self.token)

    def get_db_prep_value(self, value):
        if not value: return
        assert(isinstance(value, list) or isinstance(value, tuple))
        return self.token.join([unicode(s) for s in value])

    def value_to_string(self, obj):
        value = self._get_val_from_obj(obj)
        return self.get_db_prep_value(value)
{% endhighlight %}
