<p>In response to a few suggestions from users, I had been thinking of ways to improve <a href="http://www.pastethat.com/">PasteThat</a>. While I feel it's a superb engine for what it does, I think it can be expanded.</p>

<p>I've considered adding authentication and library features. What this would do is allow users who want long-term data available to sign-up and submit those pastes. They would then be able to "share" galleries. You'd simply tag a paste with any number of tags, and select that it is public.</p>

<p>These galleries could then be syndicated, to a different page or PasteThat, or I considered using one of my domains (such as Nibbits). That page could then allow users possibly rate and comment on the code, images, or URLs (seems strange). It would include a simple bookmarking system as well.</p>

<p>The core idea behind it, would be exactly the same as PasteThat currently is, except that it would be much easier to publicly share code (that is more than just a temporary paste), as I do quite often via my blog.</p>
