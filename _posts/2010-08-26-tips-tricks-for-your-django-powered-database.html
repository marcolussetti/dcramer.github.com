<p>Tonight was our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-San-Francisco-Django-Meetup-Group/">Django meetup</a> here in San Francisco. Four of us presented (three from Whiskey, outnumbering everyone as always ;), with some pretty great material. A few of my favorites were .update() from Andy McCurdy, (I have to love anyone that agrees), formfield_overrides (not sure how I didn't know about this) for the admin by Honza Kr√°l, and definitely more food for though from Ted Nyman on Redis. For those who aren't lucky enough there's a <a href="http://www.justin.tv/whiskeymedia/b/268976029">video available</a>, and you can grab my slides over at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/zeeg/db-tips-tricks-django-meetup">SlideShare</a>.</p>

<p>My favorite part of the tonight:</p>
