<p>Yesterday an old colleague dropped me a message saying SC2 beta accounts had started to pop up. I was hopeful, but didn't expect to get in right away. So, I jumped over to my Battle.net account, and to my surprise there it was. A few hours later I received an email from Blizzard as well:</p>

<blockquote>Congratulations! You’ve been selected to participate in the beta test of StarCraft® II: Wings of Liberty™.</blockquote>

<p>Now we begin the tedious process of dissecting StarCraft 2 and it's maps. First impressions: it's going to be hell :)</p>

<p>Oh, ya, and I'll be throwing up random <a href="http://www.nibbits.com/sc2/gallery/">StarCraft 2 media on Nibbits</a> as I get time to play.</p>
