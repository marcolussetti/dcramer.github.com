Today is my first day as a full-time employee of Sentry.

For the past three years [Chris](https://twitter.com/ckj) and I have bootstrapped Sentry, and for quite a while it was very much a side project. We've kept it profitable the entire time, and in some ways we've grown along with the company itself. It wasn't until a few months ago that we decided it was finally time to make a change. 2015 is the first year that both Chris and myself are dedicating 100% of our time to our company.

Getting to this point has been a wild ride. When we started this business we were both still building Disqus. Shortly after, Chris left for GitHub. I left for a brief stint at tenXer, and then on to Dropbox. I'm super thankful for the opportunities that I've had, but even more grateful that I now get to spend my time working on our vision of a company.

I'm super excited about what we're doing next, and I hope everyone else is too. In the last few weeks we pushed out some pretty major changes to Sentry, including [launching Organizations](http://blog.getsentry.com/2014/12/15/introducing-organizations.html), the [beginnings of our API](http://blog.getsentry.com/2014/12/18/sentry-api.html), and most recently we tagged the [7.0.0 public release](http://sentry.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog/index.html#version-7-0-0).

Sentry is the first thing you'll see from us, and we'll be continually improving it, but it wont be the last.

Cheers to 2015.

p.s. If you're hosting Sentry yourself, we'd love to [hear from you](mailto:hello@getsentry.com).
