title: Problems Uploading Packages with Setuptools on OS X

<p>This is mostly a note to myself, but also since my blog is very helpful to fellow Google-users I figured I'd throw it up here publicly.</p>

<p>Today I needed to update a package on PyPi using setuptools:</p>

<pre>python setup.py sdist register upload</pre>

<p>The problem was, no matter what I did, I always seemed to get this error:</p>

<pre><strong>Upload failed (401): You must be identified to edit package information</strong></pre>

<p>I also noticed that while it was asking me to save my login information, and I hit Y everytime, it still asked me for the username and password. It turned out that it was saving the information incorrectly as follows:</p>

<pre><br>[pypi]<br>username:dcramer<br>password:*******<br></pre>

<p>Changing it out to this solved the problems:</p>

<pre><br>[server-login]<br>username:dcramer<br>password:********<br></pre>

<p>Can't quite explain it, but as I'm sure other people have come across this same issue, maybe it will get resolved in the near future.</p>
