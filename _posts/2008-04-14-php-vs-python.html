title: PHP vs Python -- Where Opinions Aren't Wanted

<p>Constantly, and only in Python channels, I hear the argument brought up that "PHP is &lt;insert random insult&gt;" or "&lt;N&gt; is a PHP developer so he must suck". One of the things I hate most, is stereotypes, based on false information. Stereotypes about people from Texas being rednecks are ok, because it's true. Now, let's get into this a bit more.</p>

<p>PHP is thought of as a poor language because:<br><ul><br><li>Namespaces are nonexistent.</li><br><li>There are 80000 globals.</li><br><li>The language is very lazy in its syntax. You can code in at least a dozen styles.</li><br><li>You haven't used the language but you like to troll.</li><br><li>[insert a hundred random reasons]</li><br></ul></p>

<p>Now while these are VERY valid points, this doesn't make PHP a horrible language. Let's take a look at something like Perl. Now, I'm sure I'm going to get an earful for this, but it's completely fucking useless. It's not good for web apps, it's outdone for shell scripting, and it's not very useful as a scripting language (relative to other, more useful languages, such as LUA). PHP also has an extremely high availability, and is relatively simple to deploy. Python doesn't, and isn't (each site needs it's own configuration to an extent).</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, PHP tends to attract more unprofessional developers, and younger developers, because it is so widespread. If Python was the same, you would be able to talk just as much smack about it as you do PHP. So more to the point. <strong>There is nothing wrong with PHP or PHP developers</strong>.</p>

<p>And yes, I write both PHP, and Python, and I excel at both, but I prefer Python. So please, educate yourself, and stop talking shit :)</p>

<p>(For the record, no one has said anything bad about my PHP code, I just get tired of hearing the opinion "PHP sucks".)</p>

<p><strong>Correction: I wrote this hastily, so let me correct myself. I don't mean in by any shape or form Perl sucks. What I meant to say, was it's completely outdated. There haven't been any *real* updates to the language in quite a while (correct me if I'm wrong).</strong></p>
