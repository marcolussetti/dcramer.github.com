<p>As many people have recently, we experienced our internet constantly crashing while using the PS3. It turned out there were quite a few "solutions" via Google. At first we tried DMZing the router. We tried setting it between wired/wireless. Tried removing security and just locking to MAC addresses. Etc..</p>

<p>Recently, I found another solution posted online. <strong>Disable UPnP on your router</strong>. Voila no more crashing! It isn't a solution for everyone, as from what I'm told, it will stop certain things from functioning like your media sharing via the PS3 and XBox 360. For us though, it's a great solution, as we don't use those and it will no longer crash the router each time we stop playing a game on the PS3.</p>

<p>If anyone has found any other solutions, let me know, but so far this seems to be working great :)</p>
