<p>The guys over at <a href="http://www.pocoo.org">Pocoo</a> have been hard at work on Jinja 2 lately. So far it's looking awesome. The benchmarks are outstanding (putting it even further ahead of Django, and faster than Mako even), and some of the additions, and changes, such as the awesome addition to <code>for x in iterable [if expr]</code> are going to make things even easier.</p>

<p>This is my shameless plug for them, so check out the <a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/cogitations/2008/04/13/jinja2-making-things-awesome/trackback/">Jinja 2 updates</a> for more information!</p>
