<p>The author of Jinja, an alternative solution to Django templates, made a <a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/cogitations/2008/09/16/why-jinja-is-not-django-and-why-django-should-have-a-look-at-it/">great post</a> about what is wrong with the Django template engine. It's a great read if you have any doubts that the philosophy behind Django's template engine makes sense.</p>

<p>The truest quote of them all:</p>

<blockquote><br>I like the custom tag system in Django, and I wouln’t want to see it go away if the template engine is improved. But for example “ifnotequal foo bar” “endifnotequal” is no way better than “if foo != bar” “endif”.<br></blockquote>
