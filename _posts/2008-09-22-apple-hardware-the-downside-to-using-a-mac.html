title: Apple Hardware -- The downside to using a Mac

<p>Last night, in an attempt to update my PSP, I decided to switch off MAC address filtering on our router (running dd-wrt) and just use a password. I know a little about how the security works, as I was playing around with KisMAC for a while. I'm aware that WEP is completely worthless in regards to security, and also was aware that WPA is pretty much broken via brute force. So, I went with WPA (WPA2 Personal to be exact). Yay, things are fine and dandy.</p>

<p>So I wake up today, start mucking around with our diff importer for iBegin, and all of a sudden <a href="http://www.pastethat.com/Dle38">this</a> pops up in my face. "The wireless network appears to have been compromised and will be disabled for a minute.". Ok?</p>

<p>I figure maybe it was a fluke, and then all of a sudden my Macbook shuts off (not the first time, random). There goes an hours work. This could be from overheating (though my limited knowledges makes me beliee otherwise), or it's just another random issue that I get to deal with. I brought it back up, finished everything I was doing, and all of the issues were gone.</p>

<p>Oh, wait, here we are four hours later, and I was just disconnected from Wifi again with the same error as last time. Now we are here, ranting, about how I wish I could run Mac OS on my own hardware. Apple does a great job with intuitive and slick laptop designs. They do a great job with the UI of their software (I love Mac OS, no regrets). They, however, have repeatedly poor taste in how hardware should work over the years.</p>

<p>If anyone is familiar with either of these issues, and has a solution, let me know :)</p>
