<p>And then want to take a chainsaw to their operations center..</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I started playing World of Warcraft so I figured I'd just reactivate my old account. Went to login and got an "account permanently banned" notice. Well, sure, I did odd things Blizzard didn't like back in the day, but it wasn't banned when I migrated it to the Battle.net service.</p>

<p>So, I drop an email to the address that they direct you to, and here's the (fucking retarded) response I get:</p>

<blockquote>After further investigation, Blizzard has determined there is insufficient evidence that the chargeback in place on the World of Warcraft account ZEEG was a direct result of an account compromise. As such, the account will remain disabled until the negative balance of $14.99 is repaid.

<p>Please review the World of Warcraft Terms of Use at (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html), which was agreed to upon establishment of the account in question. If a charge is returned to Blizzard Entertainment for any reason, Blizzard Entertainment reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate access and the Account, as well as terminating this Agreement and all of Blizzard Entertainment's obligations hereunder.</p>

<p>These funds can only be repaid via a United States money order for the full and EXACT amount of the disputed funds: $14.99</blockquote></p>

<p>First off, negative balance? What? Explain that bullshit. I haven't played WoW in I don't know how long, and why would I still owe them money? Secondly, money order? Is this 1995 again?</p>
