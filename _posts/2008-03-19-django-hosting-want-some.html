title: Django Hosting -- Want Some?

<p>I just finished moving everything to my new server (Ubuntu 7.x), which means I can deal with installing Django. Being that I have plenty of resources (I used to have some very active websites), I'm going to offer free, with no guarantee, Django hosting. Whether you have a domain or don't, if you have a small project (a Blog, or something that's not high in traffic), I'll probably host it.<br><!--more--><br>I'm not sure how long I'll offer the solution, and it won't be managed, don't expect support from me, but I figure a lot of people might want to use Django but their shared hosting doesn't allow it.</p>

<p>Post a comment here, or use the contact link if you're interested. Hosting will be available with 0.96, or a nightly trunk build (both will be available on the server, just different python paths).</p>

<p>Some brief specs/requirements:<br><ul><br><li>Apache 2.x + mod_wsgi</li><br><li>Ubuntu 7.x</li><br><li>No Incoming Mail (unless someone convinces/walks me through setup).</li><br><li>MySQL 5.0.x/PostgreSQL 8.2.x</li><br><li>No FTP (You'll have to use SCP or SFTP).</li><br><li>You must be active in the Django space, I'm not giving it out to anyone.</li><br><li>The project must be small (the size of my blog, less than 15k uniques/day).</li><br></ul></p>
