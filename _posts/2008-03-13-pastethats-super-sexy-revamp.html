<p>I found a couple bugs tonight on <a href="http://www.pastethat.com">PasteThat</a>, by the time I was done correcting them I had redesigned the site, updated the syntax highlighter (strangely enough, which now supports 1/3 the languages it used to), and added several new features.<br><!--more--><br>The list of changes:<br>- Sleek redesign (relative to other sites) it's super sexy.<br>- You can now change the syntax while viewing a paste.<br>- Upgraded GeSHi to it's latest alpha (yep, I'm crazy like that).<br>- File uploads will now automatically convert to a paste if they can, but still allow downloads of the file.<br>- You can view both a plain, and highlighted version of the paste. Soon with line numbers again (for some reason GeSHi seems to delete a lot of features when it "updates").<br>- You can now share PasteThat (the main page) or an actual paste on it via share buttons in the header!<br>- There is now a page to view follow-up's for a paste. All follow-up's are now directly related to the original code as well. (e.g. <a href="http://www.pastethat.com/dcLLV/children">http://www.pastethat.com/dcLLV/children</a>)<br>- It will now tell you that your paste already exists (based on signature) instead of just redirecting you.</p>

<p>(Psst, you can see the follow-up handling on <a href="http://www.pastethat.com/dcLLV">memcache_test.php</a>)</p>
