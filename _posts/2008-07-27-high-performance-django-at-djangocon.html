<p>I'm going to be giving a talk at DjangoCon, <a href="http://djangocon.org/program">"High Performance Django"</a>. I will be discussing what I've done at the past with <a href="http://www.curse.com">Curse.com</a>, what we do presently for <a href="http://www.ibegin.com">iBegin's Crazy Datastore</a>, and general tips for scalability and performance in large web applications.</p>

<p>So why am I telling you all of this? I'm interested in hearing what specifically you've had a hard time dealing with in your own apps. Hurdles that you've had to come over, or that you are still trying to get over. I'm looking for good topics to fill in the time, and real world examples that are more than just my own that I may be able to dissect.</p>

<p>if you've got anything, throw me an <a href="mailto:dcramer@gmail.com">email</a>, or leave a comment here about it.</p>
