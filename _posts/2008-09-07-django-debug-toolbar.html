<p>After the presentation yesterday evening, and Cal Anderson showing Pownce's debug toolbar for a moment, it seemed like a great idea to create a pluggable out of it. It turned out I wasn't the only one with this idea.</p>

<p>I ended up creating a few "panels" inside of an overlay toolbar, which showed things like SQL queries, profile output, and cache hits/misses. At the same time, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/robhudson">Rob Hudson</a> had created a pluggable framework for handling these "panels". After somehow running into each other in the lounge at the hotel, we successfully managed to add my panels to the <a href="http://github.com/dcramer/django-debug-toolbar/tree/master">django-debug-toolbar project</a>.</p>

<p>The project is pretty neat. It's quite simple, and allows you to have access to some very nice debug/profiling information as long as you are listed in INTERNAL_IPS. It's also extendable via panel system, which Rob created.</p>

<p>I'm not sure when an "official" release will be made, but there's still a few things planned, both by myself, and by Rob, which will make this a killer app to use.</p>

<p>For now, here's some screens...</p>

<p>(We haven't implemented a profile module solution completely yet into the panel system)</p>
