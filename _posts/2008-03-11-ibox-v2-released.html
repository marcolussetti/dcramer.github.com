title: A Better Lightbox - iBox v2

---
<p>One of my first projects at the new company has been updating a script called iBox. Most people are familiar with the concept, that of lightbox, as well as how inefficient most of the scripts are. The goal of iBox is simple: provide a lightweight modal dialog box with additional support for document types to act as an <a href="http://gamma.ibegin.com/ibox/">efficient alternative to lightbox</a>. iBox v2 does just that!<br><!--more--><br>In addition to the support that was already present for AJAX Documents, Inline Containers, and Images, we have also added built-in support for YouTube links. The script also now has completely plugin support as well so users can write their own plugins.</p>

<p>We have also taken the time to make skinning much more user-friendly. We've even included a couple example skins, one of which make it look and feel a lot like lightbox. There are still a few quirks with certain CSS attributes causing the box to not size properly (the darkbox example skin shows one), but most can be worked around.</p>

<p>Feedback, and more information, can be found on the <a href="http://gamma.ibegin.com/ibox/">iBox Gamma Page</a>. You will also be able to find more information on some open-source projects we are working on, such as <a href="http://gamma.ibegin.com/share/">iBegin Share</a>, and a new site we'll be launching called iBegin Places.</p>
