<p>Today I undertook the challenge, or rather the lack-of, of <a href="http://lussumo.com/addons/index.php?PostBackAction=AddOn&AddOnID=130">integrating the MediaWiki userbase with Vanilla's forum software</a>. This provides the nice ability to run MediaWiki and Vanilla forums without having two distinct authentication systems. It's also a nice way of making people apply for access to edit the Wiki :)</p>

<p>Because Wordpress is horrible with this kind of stuff, I've moved it to <a href="http://lussumo.com/addons/index.php?PostBackAction=AddOn&AddOnID=130">Lussumo's extension's page</a>.</p>
