2015 was a good year. No, it was a GREAT year:

- Chris and I finally [took the plunge](http://blog.getsentry.com/2015/06/30/driven-by-open-source.html) and did Sentry full-time.
- We hired five of the best people we knew ([Armin](http://blog.getsentry.com/2015/03/31/welcome-armin-ronacher.html), [Ben](http://blog.getsentry.com/2015/08/03/welcome-ben-vinegar.html), [Matt](http://blog.getsentry.com/2015/09/01/welcome-matt-robenolt.html), [Ted](http://blog.getsentry.com/2015/09/01/welcome-ted-kaemming.html), and [Eric](http://blog.getsentry.com/2015/11/11/welcome-eric-feng.html)).
- A year-long project, [Sentry 8 finally saw the light of day](http://blog.getsentry.com/2015/10/08/sentry-8-is-here.html).
- Went backpacking for the first time. Summited a peak for the first time.
- Hosted Sentry surpassed [60 billion processed errors](https://live.getsentry.com).
- I finally (after too many years) caved to reading, and finished 16 novels last year.
- We doubled ARR on our hosted product in the past six months (go team!).
- The company moved from coffee shops into [our first office](https://www.facebook.com/lindsaykmeyer/media_set?set=a.10101880846310767.1073741874.5604323&type=3&pnref=story).
- Hit the big 3–0. It’s all downhill from here, right?

I’m stoked about what 2016 is going to bring. On a personal level I’m super excited for Oculus Rift launch this year, as well as the potential it holds. I’m also aiming to spend even more of the Summer (and some of the Winter!) backpacking again this year, with an ambitious goal to climb Rainier in the Spring of 2017.

For Sentry it’s going to be an even bigger year. We’ve got ambitious goals for the company, anticipating growing from a team of seven to a (oof!) 20 by the end of the year. As part of that we’ll be greatly expanding the scope of the product, and I for one can’t wait to share with everyone what it looks like.

Cheers to 2016, the best is yet to come!
