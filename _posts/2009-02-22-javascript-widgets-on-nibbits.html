<p>Quite a while back I introduced basic JavaScript widgets on Nibbits. These let site owners embed a simple box on their own site which shows basic information, as well as a download link for their maps.</p>

<p>So, why am I posting about this? Simply to spread the word, and to demo it of course :)</p>
