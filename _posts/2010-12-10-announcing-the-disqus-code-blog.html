<p>Yesterday we semi-silently launched our <a href="http://code.disqus.com/">engineering blog and project site</a> over at DISQUS. We're going to be aggregating posts from all of the engineering team's personal blogs, as well as putting all of our open source projects and conference coverage over there. Look for all of the juicy details with what we're building in Python and Django, and how we scale those apps.</p>

<p>As I'm sure many will ask what we're using to power that site, the answer is GitHub. We originally had looked at using Tumblr to aggregate RSS feeds into a new blog, but their existing tools werent powerful enough. By the time we had written our own (to import a post and tag it appropriately), we realized that their API just wasn't responsive (or available) enough. In the end we decided to use <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll blog application</a>. Being that this is GitHub, you can also check out the <a href="https://github.com/disqus/disqus.github.com">source to our blog</a> if you dare. We're still fairly new to Jekyll, so don't use us as best practices just yet.</p>

<p>Oh, and don't forget to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/DisqusCode">subscribe</a> to updates :)</p>
