I’m not a good engineer. I never studied computer science, I’m absolutely terrible at formulating my thoughts into Mathematics, and I can’t write a working line of code without unit tests.

I am, however, a problem solver.

## A Recurring Theme

Over the years I’ve come to appreciate certain types of engineers. Those engineers were all capable of managing themselves. They’re the kind of person who would push that little bit extra to find an answer.

At Disqus we were fairly small so we didn’t bring on too many new engineers. That also meant we could be much more rigorous in the selection, but we also interviewed far fewer candidates.

After spending a year and a half at a fast growing company I’ve been able to witness many different types of candidates. The primary difference was a majority of hires are new grads. It’s not a bad thing, but it’s an interesting perspective.

A theme you continually see at startups is full-stack engineers. In other words, someone who knows how to get a lot of shit done. You’d assume this comes with experience (as it can), but I’ve definitely witnessed new grads who show that same level of caliber. It’s not someone who knows how to solve the problem, it’s someone who knows how to look for the answer.

## Google It

For me the best thing that happened to our generation was Google. Not necessarily Google itself, but the idea of search. The Internet is a sprawling amount of unstructured information, and products like Google Search empower people like myself to solve problems they have little to no experience in.

My days are split into two kinds of categories: ones where I know what I need to do, and ones where everything is burning to the ground. Tools like search allow me to deal with that rain of fire.

Do you remember how to configure HSTS in Nginx off the top of your head? I intentionally don’t. A quick Google will give me a link to Stack Overflow or some random blog post, both of which will happily give me the answer. I don’t need to maintain that knowledge, because the Internet is doing it for me.

## Appreciation

In the past I’ve under appreciated people who are willing to answer questions themselves. It took working with a larger group of engineers for that to change. Seeing the contrast between new grads and experienced engineers has helped. Most notably how someone with context and knowledge can be fairly effective until they hit an issue in unexplored territory.

For me there is a new level of respect to someone, especially a new grad, who can tackle the day-to-day without hand holding. It seems like it should fairly obvious, but I also think it’s a hard quality to interview for. How do you test for something that is yet unknown? It very well could be this is what many of the famous interview questions from companies like Microsoft are designed for.

## Be a Problem Solver

Spend a few extra minutes looking for an answer. Be open to asking questions on various mediums (Stack Overflow, Twitter, IRC). Literally type in “How do I [X]” into Google. Be surprised at how easy things get.

While writing this I was referenced this quote by Abe Lincoln:

“Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe”

Their response was simply: “You are the zero hours sharpening guy.” That’s exactly what I am for.
