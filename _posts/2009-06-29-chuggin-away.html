<p>I haven't made too many posts lately. Whether it's been from lack of time, or simply nothing to write about who's to say. That doesn't mean I haven't been keeping busy though.</p>

<p>We've been hard at work over at <a href="http://www.ibegin.com/">iBegin</a> deploying some new architecture. It's a pretty cool feat, but I can't say too much about it at the moment. Recently we released an update to iBegin Share as well, which has been much needed. It adds in some more configuration, bug fixes, and overall appeal for the plugin. It also can be automatically updated through WP.org finally :)</p>

<p>In Lifestream news there's been a slew of updates. Not only have we been keeping them flowing for the <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lifestream/">plugin</a>, but we're also getting much closer to opening up our service to users. The plugin itself has gained a ton of extensibility in the form of droppable themes, extensions, and even icon sets. It's finally nearing that 1.0 mark, and about time if I may say so.</p>

<p>As for the service we've been rewriting things (again) to bring it more in line with the <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">Activity Streams</a> spec. This will make it much easier for existing sites to extend it, as well as making it easier for us to pull in activity streams. On top of that, we've got a brand new sexy design (you'll see it soon) to go with it. Look more for this on the holiday weekend, as we begin to rollout <a href="http://www.lifestrm.com">lifestrm.com</a>.</p>

<p>One last thing you'll notice, is the changes on my blog. Below certain posts you'll start seeing a blurb of events that have occurred around the time of that post. It's a proof of concept I'm working on for tighter integration of Lifestream with the blog.</p>
