<p>Wowhead.com, a very popular, World of Warcraft site with growth records spiking as high (if not higher) than Curse's when it first launched seems to have given up (just like nearly everyone else). I was informed by <a href="http://www.techsoapbox.com/hot-off-the-presses-wowhead-sold-for-over-1-million/">a colleague</a> today that they were purchased by "Affinity Media" -- one of IGE's many fronts, parent companys, child companies; not that I know, or care, but they are related.</p>

<p>IGE, for those who aren't familiar, is one of the largest and most controversial virtual currency providers in online gaming. It has been hated, and used, by massive amounts of players over the last few years.</p>

<p>Over the past year it had been my theory that IGE had been taking a hit, or several, losing enormous amounts of money from their investments, and even more from the gaming publishers and developers cracking down on virtual currency distribution. They wasted way too much cash, on too many sites, and then they did nothing. The site's are still fairly large, but sites like Wowhead quickly took the spotlight, as they were created by passionate, driven people.</p>

<p>Now with yet another site in their grasps, one can only assume that they haven't wisened up enough to actually learn how to compete in the market. Guess this means we have one less competitor out there now :)</p>
