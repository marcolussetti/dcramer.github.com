<p>I've been out of touch for a little over a month now as I've been transitioning from the west to east coast. I decided it would be "fun" to head back to my hometown for the summer, and fun it has been.</p>

<p>While looking for a place I had been using tethering on my AT&T network (oh, let me mention I'm in Nebraska), which is pretty cool. What is even more cool is that they trick you into paying an extra $40 for the access when you already pay $40 for unlimited data usage (want to see my $200 cell bill?). Even better, is that there's a "100 mile deadzone where you are", oh wow, that's great, and I'm standing next to the cell tower too! What service I do get, is old-school 2k/s network speeds.</p>

<p>Next up, I finally gave up on Leopard issues, and reverted to Tiger, only to have some interesting issues crop up. I did this all while running on my awesome bluetooth tethering (did I mention AT&T wouldn't even officially tell me how to get internet running on my Mac?). Two hours to download MySQL, yes! I've finally gotten back into working mode after about a week of struggles.</p>

<p>Today I committed a few changes to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-sphinx">django-sphinx</a> which hopefully solve any issues that were present with the <code>filter</code> methods. My apologies for not catching these before releasing the newest version.</p>

<p>I've also been working on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-ratings">django-ratings</a>. The code should be usable, but is still in it's early stages. I've been considering, from a suggestion, of removing the choices option, and changing it to a sort-of precision argument. The values would then range from -1.0 to +1.0 and you'd simply tell it the precision at which votes are tallied.</p>

<p>We also released a new version of <a href="http://www.ibegin.com/labs/share/">iBegin Share</a> sometime last week, which addresses a few problems and adds color themes as well as the ability to embed share links in feeds and other similar content (geared mostly towards the Wordpress plugin).</p>

<p>I also threw up a quick Mercurial bundle with some changes to the Django support in <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/1">Jinja</a></p>
