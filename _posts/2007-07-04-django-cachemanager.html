<p>Tired of writing cache.set code?</p>

<p>This is something I'll be polishing up over the next few days, but the paste is pretty self explanatory. We will release the source (packaged) on code.curse.com as soon as its finalized and we generate unittests/proper docs.</p>

<p>I will throw this up on DjangoSnippets as soon as James creates a lost password or change password form :P</p>
