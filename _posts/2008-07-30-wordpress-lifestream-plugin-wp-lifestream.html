<p>I had recently installed a plugin on my blogged called "RSS Stream". The idea of the plugin is that it can use RSS feeds (and only RSS feeds) from sites to display a mini-feed, or mini-blog, of what you're doing. Not being quite content with the plugin, I decided to write my own.</p>

<p>A few hours later, <a href="http://www.davidcramer.net/my-projects/lifestream">wp-lifestream</a> was born. It's a very extensible plugin that works with any kind of feed, even if it's not XML. The default generic plugin handles both RSS and Atom feeds perfectly, but I had to drop the usage the built-in Magpie and include SimplePIE (since Magpie kept erroring).</p>

<p>By default it includes all of the extensions which were in RSS Stream, as well as a Digg plugin.</p>
