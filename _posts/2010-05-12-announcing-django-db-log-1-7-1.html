title: Announcing django-db-log 1.7.1

<p>Today I pushed out a slight overhaul to the UI (and functionality) of django-db-log. The 1.7 version set (use 1.7.1 as 1.7 had a couple minor issues).</p>

<p>Here's the brief changeset:<br><ul><li>Renders full debugging pages just like you'd see with Django (only for newly logged errors) under the new Messages admin.</li><li>Supports logging full exceptions with the python logging handler via the built-in <code>exc_info</code> keyword argument.</li><li>Better support for logging fallbacks if django-db-log fails.</li><li>Overall improved administration interface.</li></ul></p>

<p>The changeset is fairly small, but the headliner is a big one. It allows you to easily debug a request as if it had just happened (by seeing full tracebacks, local variables, etc.). It works with any of the exception handling methods: middleware, create_from_exception, and create_from_record (which is what the logging handler uses).</p>

<p>Here's a sexy preview of it in use over at our development environment on Disqus:</p>
