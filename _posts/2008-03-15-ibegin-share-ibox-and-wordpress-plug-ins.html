<p>Today we released <a href="http://gamma.ibegin.com/share/">iBegin Share v2.10</a>, a complete rewrite to the original, <a href="http://gamma.ibegin.com/ibox/">iBox v2.11</a>, and WordPress plug-in's to go along with each of them (see Share below this post).<br><!--more--><br>The iBegin Share update includes a huge overhaul in the codebase. Almost everything is JavaScript based now, which eliminates the PHP requirements for half of the plug-ins to function. It also has completely plug-in support so you can develop your own quickly and easily.</p>

<p>iBox v2.11 includes some solves some much requested issues. Inline containers will no longer conflict with their unique IDs, the overlay should position more accurately across all browsers, and best of all, plug-in support has been improved.</p>

<p>The WordPress plug-ins are very simple to install and use. You simply drop the folder in your plugins directory (e.g. <code>./plugins/ibegin_share/ibegin_share.php</code>), enable it, and you're good to go. The iBegin Share plug-in also includes quite a few options and is very flexible in what it lets you do with your blogs design.</p>

<p>Hope you all enjoy, and if you have any feedback, make sure you hit the <a href="http://gamma.ibegin.com/forum/">iBegin Gamma Forum</a>!</p>
