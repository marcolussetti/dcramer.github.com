I always enjoy thinking about change and progress -- specifically how things have affected me over time. This last year, just like all of them before it, continued to push everything to new heights.

We started the year off fundraising for Sentry, [closing our $9mm Series A round](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/23/real-time-crash-reporting-tool-sentry-grabs-9-million-from-nea-accel/). We had quietly raised a Seed just six months prior, and while I was hesistent to go through the process yet again, I found it to be significantly easier the second time around. Huge thanks to Dan Levine (our partner at Accel) as he was crucial in ensuring the process was smooth and coordinated -- two things that I'm not.

Last year I set a goal to climb Rainier in 2017. That still feels a little too ambitious, but Ted and I did [summit Mt Shasta (14,179ft!)](/images/posts/2017-review/shasta.jpg) via the Hotlum-Bolam Ridge in the summer. It was definitely one of the hardest things I've ever done, and a huge personal milestone. I also spent 5 nights in Glacier National Park, as well as a handful of other trips both in the winter and summer.

Ultimately the biggest change in 2016 was our team. We started the year at 8 and [grew to an amazing group of 22](https://sentry.io/about/). We not only made some huge shifts in how we approached hiring, but we also started building out more of the business side. To support that required us to give up our tiny space in Potrero to make way for a 6,000 sqft space downtown. Crazy that there were only three of us going into the summer of 2015.

2017 is going to be an interesting year. It amazes to me to think about how much my life -- and myself -- have changed over the last few years, but I fully expect this year to be an even larger commitment to that process. I'm both hugely excited and scared for things yet to come. There's no better way to figure out who you can be than to push yourself into new directions. ðŸ¥‚ to 2017!
