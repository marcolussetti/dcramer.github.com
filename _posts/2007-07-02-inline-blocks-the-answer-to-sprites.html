title: Inline Blocks -- The Answer to Sprites

<p>We've been working a lot on the new design at Curse lately, and one thing we've used heavily are CSS sprites. The only issue we had with these is they have to be a block element (or an inline-block element) in order to display them properly.</p>

<p>My first solution was to simply float them and wrap them in a fixed height container. This worked, but you can't use text-align when they are floated. About a week later while I was looking at some cool CSS trick I found a better solution: inline-block wrappers.</p>

<p>``inline-block`` is a value usable on display, which makes your element act like a block element, but without clearing content around it. The problem arises though, that inline-block does not work in older browsers.</p>

<p>The solution: wrap your block element in a container using inline-block styles. Below is the example and solution.</p>

{% highlight css %}
.inline {
    display: -moz-inline-block;
    display: -moz-inline-box;
    display: inline-block;
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
&lt;span class="inline"&gt;&lt;div&gt;My inline block element&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
{% endhighlight %}
