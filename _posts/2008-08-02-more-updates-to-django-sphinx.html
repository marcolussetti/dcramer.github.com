<p>I was working on our search for the new <a href="http://www.ibegin.com/">iBegin</a> today, which utilizes Sphinx, Django, and obviously, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-sphinx/">django-sphinx</a>. Being the person who hates doing tedious work, I found a few issues in the newly done configuration generation.</p>

<ul><li>Errors hardcore in 0.98</li><li>It wasn't generating attributes for floats (latitude/longitude)</li><li>Didn't work with custom index names</li></ul>

<p>So tonight, after a few hours, I've refactored a good chunk of the manager code, as well as the config generation code. Among the updates include:</p>

<ul><li>There is now an included api for 0.98, as well as proper configuration generation. To use it simply do the following in <code>settings.py</code>:<pre>SPHINX_API_VERSION = 0x113</pre><br></li><li>The api support is very flexible for future versions (just requires override templates and inclusion of the api).</li><li>The generation command via manage.py now properly generates sample config for ANY model with Sphinx attached to it.</li><li>You can now pass the <code>UpdateAttributes()</code> command via <code>instance.sphinx.update(kwargs)</code>.</li></ul>

<p>As always, grab the code over at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-sphinx/">Google</a> and make sure to subscribe to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-sphinx">Google group</a> to be spammed with updates.</p>
