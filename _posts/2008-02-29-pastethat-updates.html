<p>I've updated <a href="http://www.pastethat.com/">PasteThat</a> to include support for files (including images) and links. It will soon replace my image hosting site (NukeAfrica). The site allows you to upload files up to 5 megs in size (right now) and if it's an image will do some extra handling. The templates around the file/link hosting are still fairly rough, as I was trying to hurry. In regards to links, its pretty much a copy/paste of how sites like TinyURL function. There are also now hash checks whenever submitting a new paste to prevent duplicates.</p>

<p>I plan to release the source for PasteThat when I get more time to finish up the templating.</p>
