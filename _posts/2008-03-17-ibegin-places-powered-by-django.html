<p><a href='/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/picture-1.png'><img src="http://www.davidcramer.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/picture-1.png" alt="" title="picture-" width="150" height="70" class="alignleft size-thumbnail attachment wp-att-104" /></a>We've launched our first new site over at iBegin, and it's called <a href="http://places.ibegin.com/">Places</a>. It's an experiment in mapping informal spaces, or outlining landmarks and other types of locations that you wouldn't normally find on a map. The framework was built in about a week, and is powered by Django, MySQL, the Jinja templating engine, and of course, Google Maps.<br><!--more--><br>Using the same framework that powers places, we also launched <a href="http://places.ibegin.com/zillow/">a site for previewing the neighborhood data brought to you by Zillow</a>. It also allows you to export that data in KML and GeoRSS without the hassle of dealing with shape files.</p>

<p>At iBegin we are currently working on several other Django projects, the core of which will power <a href="http://www.ibegin.com/">www.ibegin.com</a> (which is currently written in PHP). We've just started on the overhaul, but we've already got some neat partitioning tools built for our complex database structure. Anyways, more to come in the coming weeks, and I hope everyone enjoys a lot of the open source work we're doing :)</p>
