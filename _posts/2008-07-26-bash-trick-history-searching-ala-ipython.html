title: "Bash Trick: History Searching ala iPython"

<p>Recently I ran across a trick on the net. I use iPython quite a bit, and I love how I can type a partial history command, and then use up/down to cycle through the recently used commands/code lines. I thought it would be pretty cool to have this same technique available in the bash prompt. After a bit of searching, I found some results, so here you go:</p>

<pre># Enable bash history<br>export HISTCONTROL=erasedups<br>export HISTSIZE=10000<br>shopt -s histappend

<p># These set up/down to do the history searching<br>bind '"\e[A"':history-search-backward<br>bind '"\e[B"':history-search-forward<br></pre></p>
