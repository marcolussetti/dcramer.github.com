<p>Since we're having some issues at Curse (hardware now :P) and because our technologies page doesnt explain everything, below are more technical details.</p>

<p>Software:<br><ul><br><li>Apache2  + mod_python for the web servers</li><br><li>lighttpd + fcgi (mostly for static, we had SEVERE issues using fcgi for the entire Django site, weakref stuff, never found a solution)</li><br><li>memcached -- every web server runs a copy and I believe we have 2gb allocated per-server</li><br><li>Squid + lighttpd for managing requests between anonymous and logged in users</li><br><li>Sphinx -- our full-text search; the code may not reflect the current version (i'll update it soon) but check out <a href="http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/231/">djangosnippets</a></li><br><li>MySQL -- until someone can prove us wrong with facts saying PostgreSQL can scale better</li><br></ul><br>Hardware:<br><ul><br><li>5 web servers (8 yesterday): 4-8GB of memory, 2x intel core duos, memcached + apache2</li><br><li>2 static servers (one runs a small adserver script, another runs our sphinx search daemon): lighttpd + fcgi</li><br><li>2 media (download) server (running small python apps to generate images/similar): lighttpd + fcgi</li><br><li>2 cache servers: squid + lighttpd</li><br><li>2 sql servers (one is inactive but replicated): 2x intel core duos, MySQL, 6GB of memory (being upgraded :P)</li><br><li>1 dev/deployment server: the stats aren't anything out of the ordinary -- it runs various daemons as well as powering cursebeta.com</li><br></ul><br>What happens under the hood:<br><ul><br><li>The cache servers run both lighttpd and squid, forwarding requests to logged in users past the squid caches.</li><br><li>The squid caches then round robin to the web servers (which has caused extra stress due to the hardware not matching, we're working on changing this now).</li><br><li>The web servers rely heavily on memcached for key components. We cache every django.contrib.contenttypes request, every django.contrib.sites request, etc..</li><br><li>We have modified various components of Django, with patches similar to what's linked above, and with changes to select_related and some smaller systems (nothing major).</li><br><li>Most accessors to common are cached -- the method we use is messy so I'll post more when we change it.</li><br><li>Anonymous sessions are disabled -- we're still trying to manage a way to enable them and not destroy the website.</li><br><li>We use a lot of custom middleware, including a custom internationalization backend to handle our URL schemas + handle translations in the database (vs compiled files -- yes, we know it's slower)</li><br></ul></p>
