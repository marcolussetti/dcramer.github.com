<p>So I took a little time and moved my wiki off of World of Warcraft Guru since I won't be working on the site anymore. I did this for no reason other than the EULA, as Blizzard doesn't support it so it makes WG look bad. Doing this I bought a new domain, and buying a new domain lead me to buying more so I give you... <a href="http://www.hackwow.com/">HackWOW</a>, <a href="http://www.hackvanguard.com/">HackVanguard</a>, and my personal favorite, <a href="http://www.whatisige.com/">What is IGE</a>.</p>

<p>I've also begun the "blacklist my sites" project, for Google. View the source of <a href="http://www.nibbits.com/">Nibbits</a> (scroll to the bottom), and view check the pages it links to. The "theory" is that Google counts a backlink as a unique domain (or subdomain), as I've noticed with MMO Files. So in theory 1234.mmofiles.com linking to nibbits.com, counts just as much as 3124.mmofiles.com linking to nibbits.com. Now all they are is an h1 (important!) and an a tag saying "Pie" linked a page named Pie, with an H1 labeled Pie, and the word Pie in EM and STRONG on the page, as well as linked to itself. Let's see if I rank #1 in Google for Pie in 2 weeks :)</p>

<p>Last but not least, I posted some pictures of the Castle I visited recently on my "vacation". Check them out in my <a href="/photos/">photo gallery</a>.</p>
