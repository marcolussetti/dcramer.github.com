title: Blogrolls and Friendships

<p>I've been thinking about an interesting concept, and potential project lately. Most blogs have a "Blogroll", or a list of other blogs that are typically friends or colleagues. A lot of these bloggers also subscribe to those blogs with RSS readers, or whatever tool suits them. My concept was to socialize this aspect of the blogging atmosphere.</p>

<p>It would work much like your Facebook friendships. You add a friend (in this case, a website), and are notified when updates happen. It could automatically find RSS feeds on most websites (all the major blogging platforms, which is enough to matter), and would even integrate with my <a href="/my-projects/lifestream">lifestream plugin</a>. It could then generate an RSS feed of what's going on with all of your friends, including all of their lifestreamed information, and posts from their blogs, without you having to do anything beyond adding "Friends" from your blogroll.</p>

<p>Anyways, I'm posting this here to open it up to any feedback out there. I think it's a pretty cool idea, and I'm curious as to how many others would find it useful.</p>
