<p>We finally managed to get the new site pushed out the door last week, and it's been one hell of a ride. It's a complete overhaul of the old codebase, including a completely new template engine (Jinja), a new internatlization handler (in-house), and quite a few tweaks on the backend.</p>

<p>For the past week we've been struggling with it, as we've hit a bumpy road. Random problems appearing that we haven't yet been able to explain (thus, some randomly slow load times). On that note, we'll be pushing out a lot more updates, at a lot faster rate.</p>

<p>And worry not Django fans, we're going to be contributing more than ever. Brian Harring joined the team recently, his sole purpose, to make Django awesome. He's done great work in a few various places that have been enormous amounts of help to us.</p>

<p>We also just recently released a patch to add <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5020">.group_by() support</a>, although not supported by Django officially, it may be useful to some of you. We'll also possibly be releasing a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/3b33bfe1e625b4ad">new select_related() optimization</a> if people are interested, again, probably won't be adopted in trunk.</p>
