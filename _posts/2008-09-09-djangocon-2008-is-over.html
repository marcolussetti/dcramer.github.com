<p>Just got back home this evening from DjangoCon. It was really a lot of fun. It's always great to be able to put a face to a name, or a 100 faces to names, in this case. I met a lot of really cool people, and some of the presentations were fantastic (especially Cal Henderson's).</p>

<p>My presentation went fairly good. I was pretty nervous so I went to my slides way too fast and didn't go into the details like I had planned out. I will know next time to make more slides, and to have more notes on what I want to talk about. For anyone who is interested, you can view the slides on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/zeeg/django-con-high-performance-django-presentation/1?from=email&type=comment_onslide&subtype=slideshow">SlideShare</a>.</p>

<p>After hearing a lot of the opinions from people, I think the core Django team is going to take into serious consideration some of the feature requests I've wanted for a while (mostly database related). At least a good 5-10% of the speakers brought up singletons (ticket #17), and several others brought up denormalization and database clustering. I was really glad to see I wasn't as crazy as I had thought, and the only person who really needed these features.</p>

<p>A big thanks to everyone who made DjangoCon '08 possible, hope to be able to go to the next one as well :)</p>
