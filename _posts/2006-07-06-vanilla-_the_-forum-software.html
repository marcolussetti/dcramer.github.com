<p>Tired of using that piece of crap phpBB board, or maybe you'd just rather a cheaper and more user-friendly solution to vBulletin. Well, I'm happy to give my vote to a very well done project called Vanilla. Lussumo, the developers behind Vanilla, have just launched <a href="http://www.getvanilla.com/">Vanilla 1.0</a>, the first official release for the forum software.<br><blockquote>Vanilla is an open-source, standards-compliant, multi-lingual,             fully extensible discussion forum for the web. Anyone who has             web-space that meets the <a href="#ServerRequirements">requirements</a>             can download and use Vanilla for free!</blockquote><br>If you want to see it in action, you can check out their <a href="http://lussumo.com/community/">community site</a> or head over to the <a href="http://forums.hackwow.com/">forums at HackWOW</a> where we put it to use as well.</p>
