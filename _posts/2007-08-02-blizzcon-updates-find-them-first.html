<p>We've put live a new "events" section on Curse.com today. Once again, proving how quick Django is, we whipped this up in 2 days. Currently it's prepped for the <a href="http://events.curse.com/blizzcon/">Blizzcon</a> event this weekend, which we'll be covering. It aggregates data from the rest of the site based on several data keys.</p>

<p>So if you'll be attending, head over and click the giant "I'm Attending!" button. This is the first step in our user awards/badges system, in which users will receive a market saying they were attending Blizzcon 2007.</p>
