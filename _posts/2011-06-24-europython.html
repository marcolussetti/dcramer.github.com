<p>This last week I've been attending <a href="http://europython.eu">EuroPython</a> over here in Firenze (or as we Americans know it, Florence), Italy. It's been a pretty amazing time, visiting the beautiful city, putting faces to names, and seeing some great presentations. More importantly, and the main reason for my trip, was the two talks that I delivered here this week.</p>

<p>The first was on Tuesday morning, titled "<strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/zeeg/building-scalable-web-apps" title="Building Scalable Web Apps">Building Scalable Web Apps</a></strong>". I tried to show how one might solve some problems building a real web app, so we built a little bit of a backend for a Twitter-like stream.</p>

<p>I gave a second talk on Wednesday morning, "<strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/zeeg/pitfalls-of-continuous-deployment" title="Pitfalls of Continuous Deployment">Pitfalls of Continuous Deployment</a></strong>", which talks a little bit about the lessons we've learned during adoption of CD, as well as the value of integration and reporting systems</p>
