<p>It's been a hectic month getting everything done, but we've finally managed to push live the new site.Â  You'll find a whole slew of changes to the design as well as some minor tweaks to some of the features. Most noticably:<br><ul><br><li>The header now makes sense. No more double takes and confusion in finding what you want.</li><br><li>The portal pages are now modularized and show much more content.</li><br><li>The main page has been revamped greatly. It shows compilations of the best content from all over Curse, including a brand new news feed.</li><br></ul><br>We have also tuned a lot of the site for performance, and fixed numerous bugs, so <a href="http://www.curse.com/">check it out</a>!</p>
