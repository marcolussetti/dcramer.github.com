<p>So about a year ago, I posted an article about information (supported with evidence I had) saying Diablo 3 was in development, as a Massively Multiplayer Online Game, based upon the idea of Hell invading Heaven. I also told you it would be, originally, debuted at Blizzcon last year, and I was wrong. Supported by more evidence that it was in development, I concluded that it would have to be shown at E3 '06. Once again, I was wrong.</p>

<p>So why do I think it's going to air at Blizzcon 2006? Well, to be quite honest, Blizzard could slap me in the face again and I could be wrong. Just recently opened up in a Wall Street discussion saying they had developed a formula for doing an MMOG in just 3 years. Not only did they divulge some financial information to go along with this, but they also said all Blizzard "All Blizzard franchises will become MMOGs.". Who doubted me? Obviously not IGN, or any of the other major media sites who announced the upcoming release of Diablo 3 based off of my information and findings.</p>

<p>So why Blizzcon '06, why not E3 next year? Well, the original idea was that Burning Crusade would be out before Blizzcon '06, so it wouldn't make much sense to have another session covering the game, and what else are they going to cover? Sure, they could have Starcraft Ghost Release Candidate 18 for the PS3 or some other bullshit, but let's get serious. So let's look at some facts:</p>

<p>* Blizzard North closed in 2005, which was the primary location for the Diablo franchise development. The company was merged with as we know now Blizzard Entertainment.<br>* Supposedly--â€œI am musician in Czech Republic. I play not with one orchestra but with many depending on work. I have recently been to Bratislava in Slovak Republic for recording sessions with local Radio Symphony Orchestra, where we just recorded music for Diablo 3." Is this legit? You decide.<br>* Heaven vs Hell. Hell invading Heaven. Normal people don't come up with this, and if they did, they would work for a company--perhaps Blizzard Entertainment? Not only is this a very realistic environment for the Diablo franchise, but the information came from a former Blizzard employee, who was in fact working with the Diablo teams at one point.<br>* And of course, the latest information, from Blizzard saying that all franchises will become MMOGs. Granted, this doesn't mean it would happen soon, but with all the evidence supporting Diablo 3, and DMCA's I consistently receive for releasing crap, I can see this happening.</p>

<p>There is one thing I did want to address as well. As far as I recall, Blizzard said, upon attending Blizzcon, you would receive a Beta code. If I remember correctly, they also stated the Beta code would not be for the World of Warcraft expansion, but a yet unannounced game release. Two days ago, a Blizzard representative said otherwise, "..that card is your entrance to play World Of Warcraft expansion before most any one else. I would recommend following the instructions and registering." I call bullshit, riot anyone?</p>

<p>Now there is one final determining factor. Will there be a Blizzcon '06? This of course would play a huge rule on if it's announced at the event. If there isn't, which is up for debate (and I'm working on getting confirmation right now), then we may not see it until their next event, as there are no other huge announcements upcoming that I'm aware of. In my opinion they will save this for their own event, as it makes them a lot more do re me than announcing at E3 would.</p>
