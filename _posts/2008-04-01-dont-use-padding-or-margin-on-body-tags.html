title: Don't Use Padding or Margin on BODY Tags

<p>Today I was adding full screen support to <a href="http://labs.ibegin.com/ibox">iBox</a>, and I hit an IE6 bug. The bug is introduced because the <code>BODY</code> tag had either <code>margin</code> or <code>padding</code> values of more than 0. This is a number of problems we've had with calculating positions because of the <code>BODY</code> clauses containing these extra pixels.</p>

<p>The solution:</p>

{% highlight html %}
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
/* Remove the default margin and padding. */
body { padding: 0; margin: 0; }

/* Put your padding/margin on the wrapper clause. */
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id="wrapper"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The reasoning behind this, is that most JS objects which need to go outside of the page frame, are appending to BODY. When they're appending they can position themselves wherever they need to be. However, if it needs to be say, 100% height, it's a <acronym title="Pain in the Ass">PITA</acronym> to calculate that 100% if there's margin or padding on an enclosing tag.</p>
