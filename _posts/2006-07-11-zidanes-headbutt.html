<p>To be honest, I'm not a big football (soccer) fan, but the World Cup is always exciting. This year, I think it may have been even more so. With 10 minutes left in the game, the French team member Zinedine Zidane, decided he had enough. Why? Who knows, but he sure made sure an Italian player, <span class="txt3Bold">Materazzi</span><span class="txt4Bold">, by smashing his head into the Italian player's chest.</span></p>

<p>To see it in action, check out my latest site, <a href="http://www.ggzidane.com/">Good Game Zidane</a>. The site was live 10 minutes after the event, gotta love GoDaddy and my servers :)<br><span class="txt4Bold" /></p>
