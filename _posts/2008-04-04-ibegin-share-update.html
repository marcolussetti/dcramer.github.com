<p>We released new versions of iBegin Share and the Wordpress plug-in this morning. These are critical updates to solve display inconsistencies across browsers. You can grab them both over at <a href="http://labs.ibegin.com/">the labs</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't know what iBegin Share is, it's a simple tool which allows you to "share" pages of your website. It's very similar to things like ShareThis, except that it adds even more depth to the situation. You can view a demo of it by clicking "Share" below the title of this post.</p>
